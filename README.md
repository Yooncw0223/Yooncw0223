## Good morning! ☀️
My name is Chanwoo Yoon, a senior studying Computer Science 💻 at MIT. My focus is mostly on learning (ML) 🛠 and inference/predictions 📈, but I am also interested in system designs!

As to my skills, I am proficient in Python, Java, C/C++, and TypeScript/JavaScript. I am intermediate in R, Rust, and SQL. I am quite a beginner in Golang!

#### Academics: 📝

For this semester (Fall 2023 🍁), I am taking the following classes:
- Software Performance Engineering (6.172/6.1060) ⚡️
- Database Systems (6.5830) 📦
- Psychology and Economics (14.13) 🤯
- Intermediate Microeconomic Theory (14.04) 💰
- Seminar in Undergraduate Advanced Research (6.UAR) 👨🏻‍🔬

And I am also participating in the MIT AI Alignmnet program ([MAIA](https://www.mitalignment.org/)), where I would be participating in the ML track to learn more about AI safety. 🥽

#### Projects: 🛠

I like to fiddle with code. There are some projects that never got to see the light of day as I was not into using GitHub to publish my projects openly and as my laptop got wiped out last summer (😇). But those that I can recover, they will be added to this page as time passes by.

But there are some main ones that I maintain and update. To learn about them, you can visit my static blog site using this [link](https://yooncw0223-github-io.vercel.app/#/). For any questions, feel free to email me at chanwooy@mit.edu!
