### Good morning! ☀️

#### Introduction: 👋

My name is Chanwoo Yoon (He/Him), a senior studying Computer Science 💻 at MIT. My focus is mostly on learning (ML) 🛠 and inference/predictions 📈, but I am also interested in system designs! 🔨

As to my skills, I am proficient in Python, Java, C/C++, and TypeScript/JavaScript. I am intermediate in R, Rust, and SQL. I am quite a beginner in Golang!

This is my first time actually diving deep into my GitHub page customizations, so everything is/will be at work constantly. If some things feel off, feel free to email me at chanwooy@mit.edu!

#### Academics: 📝

For this semester (Fall 2023 🍁), I am taking the following classes:
- Software Performance Engineering (6.172/6.1060) ⚡️
- Database Systems (6.5830) 📦
- Psychology and Economics (14.13) 🤯
- Intermediate Microeconomic Theory (14.04) 💰
- Seminar in Undergraduate Advanced Research (6.UAR) 👨🏻‍🔬

And I am also participating in the MIT AI Alignmnet program ([MAIA](https://www.mitalignment.org/)), where I would be participating in the ML track to learn more about AI safety. 🥽

#### Projects: 🛠

I like to fiddle with code. There are some projects that never got to see the light of day as I was not into using GitHub to publish my projects openly and as my laptop got wiped out last summer (😇). But those that I can recover, they will be added to this page as time passes by.

But there are some main ones that I maintain and update:
- One open project is a simple static site that I made with React for blogging purposes. The design might change directly, or the implementations may change entirely based on how I feel about it as time passes.
- One other project I would be doing this year is developing a framework to allow secure models to be trained in the context of federated learning and cryptography. This project will be executed mostly in Rust and Python.

If any of you have any more questions, fee free to email me at chanwooy@mit.edu!
